# Security Policy for infraspective

---
version: 0.4.0
url: https://github.com/aldrichtr/infraspective
---

Security vulnerabilities are treated very seriously, and will by default take precedence over other work on the
project. As I am currently the only developer on the project, the process below is conducted by me.

## Scope and applicability

- If the vulnerability exists in PowerShell, please submit the report to [The PowerShell Team](https://github.com/PowerShell/PowerShell/security/policy)
- If the vulnerability exists in a module, service or application used by infraspective, please follow the security
  reporting guidlines for that project first
- If the vulnerability exists in infraspective (regardless of version), please report it using the process below

## Vulnerability reporting process

1. Send the report to [me directly](mailto:74787193+aldrichtr@users.noreply.github.com)
2. Based on the severity and impact of the vulnerability a new issue will be created for tracking and reporting,
   unless the impact is so severe as to warrant discretion.  In that case, a private repository will be created with
   access granted to the reporter, and myself
3. Once the details of the vulnerability have been verified, a security advisory will be created.
